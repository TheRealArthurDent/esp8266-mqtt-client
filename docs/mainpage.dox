\mainpage
A tiny sample project that is based on esp8266-wifi-participant
but is updatable over-the-air.
On startup your board will try to connect to the specified WiFi network and will
blink the built in ESP LED (GPIO 2) at 2 revolution per second while doing so.
Once successfully connected the node LED (GPIO 16) will blink at 1 revolution
per 5 seconds.
If started with "#define DEBUG" it will log the progress via the Serial port.
